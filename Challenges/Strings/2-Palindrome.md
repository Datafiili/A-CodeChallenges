# Palindrome

Palindrome is a text that can be read the same way backwards.
Many times the spaces are not counted in, but for this practice we do include them.
Examples of palindromes:
-racecar
-rotator
-madam
-2002

Write a function that checks if string is palindrome and returns a boolean. Array.reverse() function and other similar functions are Forhibidded.
