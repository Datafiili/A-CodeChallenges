# Bogo sort

Best way to start learning sorting is to start with the simplest algorithm and move towards more challenging ones.

Bogosort is a famous sorting algorithm that is used mostly for educational purposes.
The algorithm is famously bad for commercial use as it is fully based on shuffling the array.

Create a function that sorts an array by shuffling it untill it is in order. Built in array related functions aren't allowed (Array.sort(), Array.min(), etc.).
