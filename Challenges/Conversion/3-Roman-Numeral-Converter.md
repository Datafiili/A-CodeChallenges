# Roman numberal converter

Write two functions:
First functions will convert arabic numbers to Roman numerals.
Second function will do vise versa.

## Rules of Roman numerals:

Each Roman numeral has Arabic counterpart.
| Arabic | Roman |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | I |
| 5 | V |
| 10 | X |
| 50 | L |
| 100 | C |
| 500 | D |
| 1000 | M |

The Roman numbers are built by combining letters togather.
For example:

1 = I

2 = II

3 = III

Only 3 instances of same Roman numeber can be in a row.
For example IIII is incorrect.

with numbers that are one away from next unit is show by writing smaller unit before greater one. But only with 1's, 10's 100's.

4 = IV
5 = V
6 = VI
9 = IX

40 = XL
50 = L
60 = LX
90 = XC

Numbers are always written in a way where greatest number comes first.

2549 = MMDXLIX

Breaking it a part:

MM = 2000
D = 500
XL = 40
IX = 9
