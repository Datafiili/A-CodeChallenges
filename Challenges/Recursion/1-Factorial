# Factorial

Factorial are presented in form of n!

Variable n must be a natural number.

Factorial means that we multiply all natural numbers that are smaller than it onto it.

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040

The function must return the result and be recursive.
